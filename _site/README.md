## Minimal Jekyll Setup

Example repo to use Jekyll in a simpler way, without a theme and default liquid tags.

- gem install jekyll
- jekyll new my-site
- bundle open minima (default theme)
- copy/paste from _includes/* and _layouts/* and delete what you don't need

`bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
